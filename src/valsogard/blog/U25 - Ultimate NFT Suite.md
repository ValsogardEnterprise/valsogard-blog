The story of the most advanced 3D NFT system

If you think that NFTs are total crap, you may want to skip this blog post and instead read the other one that I wrote specifically for you.
For those of you who are into NFTs, this very blog post is a revelation! I am going to tell you all about the most advanced NFT system in Web3 that exists.

In the beginning, I was barely interested in NFTs. Being a highly technical 3D artist with more than a decade of experience, the initial NFT collections were totally boring and were not bringing anything new. From my perspective it was just a pure classical bubble hype, since I knew how much more advanced things can be. The NFTs, apart from uploading PNGs on blockchain, had no technology to them.
That all changed in in December 2021, at the peak of the 2021 crypto bull run. I got hired by Cosmic Universe for the position of Lead Unreal Engine Developer for their MMORPG Metaverse.
My first major task was to design and implement a system of 3D NFTs which would "convert" the flat 2D NFTs into **in-game playable 3D NFTs**. 
Just like all other Web3, Metaverse or NFT projects, Cosmic Universe started with an NFT collection of 10,000 Wizards which were, you guessed it, flat 2D NFTs profile pictures (PFPs).
Basically, the only things differentiating NFT collections back then were the art style and marketing success. The biggest competition were mostly totally crappy looking and uncreative NFT collections which were, for some reason, extremely popular. You know who I'm talking about, so I don't want to name names just to be safe on the legal side.
Cosmic Universe's first collection of Cosmic Wizards was at least beautiful and colorful. But from technical and practical perspectives, it was just another flat 2D PFP NFT collection of PNGs on OpenSea. This is exactly why I got hired, to add not just one but multiple layers of advancement.

Compared to other crappy but extremely popular NFT collections (I'm sure you know who I'm talking about, but I'm not naming names just to be safe on the legal side)
