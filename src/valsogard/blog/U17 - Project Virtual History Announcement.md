The CV-6 USS Enterprise is getting restored

Today, on December 7th 2023, we are officially announcing our newest project - Digital Restoration of the CV-6 USS Enterprise.

### What is the project?
It is a 3D digital restoration of the greatest ship newer to be preserved as a war museum ship. With this project, we aim to correct this injustice and allow everyone to remember and experience the USS Enterprise in its full glory.

### Multimedia
With the digital 3D format, we would be able to offer the experience in plenty of formats, some of them being: interactive virtual tours, video games, still images, videos, cinematics, documentaries, VR experience and more.

### Why USS Enterprise instead of some other ships?


The goal of this project is to create the ultimate experience connected with the greatest ever warship, the CV-6 USS Enterprise.
