Full story of the most advanced 3D NFT system from its very start to present day, covering the technical, marketing and business aspects.

# Short Version

- NFT hype of 2021; We knew that flat 2D NFTs were going to be short-lived unsustainable hype
- We knew that 3D interactive NFT systems are the future
- I designed and implemented the core system in as early as January 2022
- We successfully converted the NFT collection from 2D PFPs into in-game playable 3D characters
- We started adding lots of features and expansions, not focusing just on characters
- By Q3 2022, the market crashed badly and there's barely any enthusiasm for NFTs regardless of use cases or technology
- We continue developing and innovating through the bear market, expanding features and functionality
- Now multiple projects of different genres are enjoying the benefits of this project

# Intro

If you think that NFTs are totally useless and without any practical use cases, you may want to skip this blog post and instead read the other ![blog](https://valsogard.com/blog/game-nft-use-cases) that I wrote specifically for you.
For those of you who are into NFTs and see the use cases, this very blog post is a revelation! I am going to tell you all about the most advanced NFT system in Web3 that exists.

In the beginning, I was barely interested in NFTs. Being a highly technical 3D artist with more than a decade of experience, I knew that the initial NFT collections were totally boring and were not bringing anything new. From my perspective it was just a pure classical bubble hype, since I knew how much more advanced things can be. The NFTs, apart from basically uploading PNGs on blockchain, had nothing of a technology added to them.
That all changed in December 2021, at the peak of the 2021 crypto bull run. I got hired by Cosmic Universe for the position of Lead Unreal Engine Developer for their MMORPG Metaverse.
 
Just like all other Web3, Metaverse or NFT projects, Cosmic Universe started with an NFT collection of 10,000 Wizards which were, you guessed it, flat 2D NFTs profile pictures (PFPs).
Basically, the only things differentiating NFT collections back then were the art style and marketing success. The biggest competition were mostly totally crappy looking and uncreative NFT collections which were, for some reason, extremely popular. You know which collections I'm talking about, so I don't want to name names just to be safe on the legal side.
Cosmic Universe's 2D collection of Cosmic Wizards was at least beautiful and colorful. But from technical and practical perspectives, it was just another flat 2D PFP NFT collection of PNGs on OpenSea. Cosmic Universe wanted more than just that and this is exactly why they hired me, to add not just one but multiple layers of advancement into the collection and project overall.

My first major task was to design and implement a system of 3D NFTs which would "convert" the flat 2D NFTs into **in-game playable 3D NFTs**. Let me explain what "3D in-game playable" means.


The game engine of choice for Cosmic Universe was
