The CV-6 USS Enterprise is getting restored

Today, on December 10th 2023, we are officially announcing our newest project - Digital Restoration of the CV-6 USS Enterprise.
The goal of this project is to create the ultimate historical experience platform of the greatest warship ever, the CV-6 USS Enterprise.

The project consists of using the real-time 3D technology to recreate a highly detailed interactive 3D experience of the entire ship, including all of its decks, aircraft, weaponry and even the crew.
This project will be multi media, which means that anyone will be able to experience the USS Enterprise however they want - video games, images, videos, 360 videos, animations, cinematics, documentary movies, virtual tours, VR applications and more.
There's also going to be a website complementary to the project, which is going to be additional historical library with historical data of the ship itself. On the website, you will eventually be able to find everything that has to do with the CV-6 USS Enterprise: historical images and videos, battle reports, technical information about the ship, list of crew members and their biographies, books and documentaries about the ship, video games in which it appears, even memorabilia shops.

### Brief info about the CV-6 USS Enterprise:
For those who don't know how great the USS Enterpise was, it was the most performant ship of the entire World War Two.
It was a Yorktown-class aircraft carrier of the United States Navy. It was also known by different nicknames: The Big E, Lucky E, Grey Ghost.
Exactly 82 years ago, on the 10th December 1941, just three days after the Pearl Harbor attack, the USS Enterprise sank the Imperial Japanese Navy's submarine I-70, and thus became the first American warship to sink an enemy warship.
It received a total of 20 Battle Stars, participated in all except one major battles in the Pacific Ocean, and was the first ship of aircraft carrier type to receive the Presidential Unit Citation.
Unfortunately, unlike some other aircraft carriers of the Essex class, the USS Enterprise wasn't preserved as a museum ship.

To put it simply, if there was one ship in the entire history of warships that deserved to be preserved, it was the CV-6 USS Enterprise.
To many this was a big mistake, and we are trying to undo that by restoring the USS Enterprise to its full glory.

In order to reconnect with Enterprise's past, check out the website fully dedicated to the ship. There you will be able to follow the latest project updates and find out more about the ship.
