NFT categorization by ERC standards:

ERC20 - Technically speaking, ERC20 does not qualify as Non-Fungible Token. However, ERC20 is a well known standard used for creating cryptocurrency smart contracts and thus can be used for in-game currencies. Also, it can be used for Rewards and Achievements.
ERC721 - Unique items, collectibles or land ownership.
ERC1155 - Consumables.
