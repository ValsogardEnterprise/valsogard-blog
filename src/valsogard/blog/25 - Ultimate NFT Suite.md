Full story of the most advanced 3D NFT system from its very start to present day, covering the technical, marketing and business aspects.

# Short Version

- Flat 2D NFTs were crappy and unsustainable hype in 2021
- Cosmic Universe wanted in-game playable 3D NFTs, so they hired me
- I designed and implemented the core system as early as January 2022
- We successfully convert the NFT collection from 2D PFPs into in-game playable 3D characters
- We start adding lots of features and expansions
- The market crashes badly and nobody wants to hear about any NFTs
- We are left with extremely advanced technologies  

# Full Story

If you think that NFTs are total crap, you may want to skip this blog post and instead read the other one that I wrote specifically for you.
For those of you who are into NFTs, this very blog post is a revelation! I am going to tell you all about the most advanced NFT system in Web3 that exists.

In the beginning, I was barely interested in NFTs. Being a highly technical 3D artist with more than a decade of experience, the initial NFT collections were totally boring and were not bringing anything new. From my perspective it was just a pure classical bubble hype, since I knew how much more advanced things can be. The NFTs, apart from uploading PNGs on blockchain, had nothing of a technology added to them.
That all changed in December 2021, at the peak of the 2021 crypto bull run. I got hired by Cosmic Universe for the position of Lead Unreal Engine Developer for their MMORPG Metaverse.
My first major task was to design and implement a system of 3D NFTs which would "convert" the flat 2D NFTs into **in-game playable 3D NFTs**. 
Just like all other Web3, Metaverse or NFT projects, Cosmic Universe started with an NFT collection of 10,000 Wizards which were, you guessed it, flat 2D NFTs profile pictures (PFPs).
Basically, the only things differentiating NFT collections back then were the art style and marketing success. The biggest competition were mostly totally crappy looking and uncreative NFT collections which were, for some reason, extremely popular. You know which collections I'm talking about, so I don't want to name names just to be safe on the legal side.
Cosmic Universe's 2D collection of Cosmic Wizards was at least beautiful and colorful. But from technical and practical perspectives, it was just another flat 2D PFP NFT collection of PNGs on OpenSea. Cosmic Universe wanted more than just that and this is exactly why they hired me, to add not just one but multiple layers of advancement into the collection and project overall.
