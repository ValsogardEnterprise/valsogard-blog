## The Name

The name Valsogard actually came to my mind literally decades ago, when I was a small child. My sister and I would write down our names on a piece of paper and try to read them backwards and then we would call each other by our inverted names.
As my name happens to be Dragoslav, I would be called Valsogard. I never used that as a brand or nickname, although I had a friend in high school who would call me Valsogard. Still, it never stuck with me. Then, around 2017 or 2018, as my professional career was taking off, I would start to think about some brand names for my provisional company.
I was thinking of things like zen, kai-zen, wind, star, scream... trying to combine them in order to come up with something unique. When it comes to company branding, it's not just a matter of coming up with a good sounding name. Far from that, actually. You want to make sure that it's unique, that all or as many possible social media usernames are free, that .com domain is free, that it's still easy to pronounce, yet unique, yet recognizable. Whatever combination I would think of, it would be already taken.
