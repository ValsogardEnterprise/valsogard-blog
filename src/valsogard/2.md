We hate cars, we hate them so much in fact that we are doing our best to erase them from the face of the planet

# Valsogard's future without cars

The Infinite Improbability Drive was a wonderful new method of crossing interstellar 
distances in a mere nothingth of a second, without "tedious mucking about in hyperspace."

It was discovered by lucky chance and then developed into a governable form of propulsion 
by the Galactic Government's research centre on Damogran. As soon as the drive reaches infinite 
Improbability, it passes through every conceivable point in every conceivable universe simultaneously. 
An incredible range of highly improbable things can happen due to these effects.

It was installed on the Starship Heart of Gold, and both the ship and the drive were 
unveiled by then-President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox.
